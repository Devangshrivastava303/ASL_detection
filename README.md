# 🤟 ASL Detection System

An AI-powered system to detect American Sign Language (ASL) gestures in real-time using computer vision and deep learning. This project aims to help bridge the communication gap for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Real-time gesture recognition via webcam
- 🧠 Deep learning-based classification (CNN/Transfer Learning)
- 🖐️ Trained on ASL alphabet dataset
- 💬 Displays detected gesture as text on screen
- 🔌 Easy to integrate into other applications
